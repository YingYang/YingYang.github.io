	<h1>Ying Yang (杨颖)</h1>
	<p>I am a PhD candidate in neural computation and machine learning, at Carnegie Mellon University. I am generally interested statistical models for neuoimaging and human visual cognition. I have been working on source localization in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), and developed models to study correlation between neural signals and external features, as well as models to estimate connectivity between regions. Using these models, we study the spatio-temporal dynamics in human visual cortex. Specifically, we explore what information is coded at different time points and brain areas and how information flows.
