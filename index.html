	<h1>Ying Yang (杨颖)</h1>
	<p>I am generally interested statistical models for neuoimaging and human visual cognition. <em> 
           I have been working on source localization in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalogram (EEG). <em> 
	   I developed regression models to study correlation between neural signals and external features, as well as models to estimate connectivity between regions in MEG and EEG. <em>
	   Using these models, we study the spatio-temporal dynamics in human visual cortex, specifically, we explore what information is coded at different time points and brain areas, and how information flows. </a></p>
